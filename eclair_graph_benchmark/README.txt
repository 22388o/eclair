Micro-benchmarking the eclair router


To build the project run "mvn clean install"
To run the benchmark use "java -jar target/benchmark.jar -f 1 -i 1" this is the simplest benchmark run, use -h to discover new options


Custom implementation results:
# Run complete. Total time: 00:03:18

REMEMBER: The numbers below are just data. To gain reusable insights, you need to follow up on
why the numbers are the way they are. Use profilers (see -prof, -lprof), design factorial
experiments, perform baseline and negative tests that provide experimental control, make sure
the benchmarking environment is safe on JVM/OS/HW level, ask for reviews from the domain experts.
Do not assume the numbers tell you what you want them to tell.
